Hello! I'm a fifth year economics PhD candidate at Texas A&M University with interests in public and labor economics, with a focus on disability and education. My research uses both RCTs and quasi-experimental methods. I was a 2024-25 NBER Retirement and Disability Research Consortium Pre-doctoral Fellow. Prior to starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics at University of South Florida, a Master's of Arts in Economics and a Certificate in Applied Statistics at University of South Carolina. I also worked as a Research Assistant for Dr. Jeffrey Thompson at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the New England Public Policy Center.

<br/><br/>

I will be available on the 2025-26 job market.
