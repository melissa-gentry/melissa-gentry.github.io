Hello! I'm a second year PhD student in economics at Texas A&M University with interests in public and labor economics, with a focus on education. Prior to starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics at University of South Florida, a Master's of Arts in Economics and a Certificate in Applied Statistics at University of South Carolina. I have also worked as a Research Assistant for Dr. Jeffrey Thompson at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the New England Public Policy Center.

My publications, working papers, and academic experience can be found in the tabs above. A PDF copy of my CV can be downloaded [here](http://melissa-gentry.github.io/files/Gentry_CV_122022.pdf).
