Hello! I'm a fifth year economics PhD candidate at Texas A&M University with interests in applied microeconomics, with a focus on disability and education. My research uses both quasi-experimental methods and field experiments. I was a 2024-25 NBER Retirement and Disability Research Consortium Pre-doctoral Fellow. 

<br/><br/>

I will be available on the 2025-26 job market. 

<br/><br/>

My job market paper, which explores the impact of rideshare access on economic and social outcomes for disabled adults, can be found in the research tab above alongside publications and other works in progress.
