Hello! I'm a fifth year economics PhD candidate at Texas A&M University with interests in applied microeconomics, with a focus on disability and education. My research uses both RCTs and quasi-experimental methods. I was a 2024-25 NBER Retirement and Disability Research Consortium Pre-doctoral Fellow. 

<br/><br/>

I will be available on the 2025-26 job market.
