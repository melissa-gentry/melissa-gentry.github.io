Hello! I'm a third year PhD student in economics at Texas A&M University with interests in public and labor economics, with a focus on education and disability. My research uses both RCTs and quasi-experimental methods. Prior to starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Quantitative Economics and Econometrics at University of South Florida, a Master's of Arts in Economics and a Certificate in Applied Statistics at University of South Carolina. I have also worked as a Research Assistant for Dr. Jeffrey Thompson at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the New England Public Policy Center.
