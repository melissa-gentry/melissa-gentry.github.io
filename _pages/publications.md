### "Agricultural Aid and Agricultural Production in Africa"
Journal of African Development, 2020 With Kwabena Gyimah-Brempong

This paper uses panel data and a dynamic common correlated effect
estimator to investigate the effects of non-food agricultural aid on agricultural output in African countries during the 1970 to 2018 period. Using five measures of agricultural outputs in per capita terms and controlling for a number of covariates, we find that non-food agricultural aid, at the aggregate level, has positive and statistically significant short- and long-term effects on agricultural output in African countries. Using disaggregated aid data, we also find that several components of non-food agricultural aid have significant positive effects on agricultural output in Africa, while some components of non-food agricultural aid have no significant effect on agricultural output, suggesting that the composition of the aid matters for aid effectiveness. The results are robust to several specifications and different estimation methodologies including estimators that account for cross-sectional dependence. The results of this paper have implications on aid policy and research. [Download paper here](http://melissa-gentry.github.io/files/jafrideve_21.pdf)


### "Can High School Counselors Help the Economics Pipeline?" 
with Danila Serra and Jonathan Meer. AEA: Papers and Proceedings (May 2023)

High school guidance counselors play an important role in advising high school students on their study and career paths. However, the literature on their characteristics, attitudes and behaviors – including the information they have and share with students on different majors – is scarce. We evaluate the impact of an intervention aimed at informing high school guidance counselors about the field of economics, i.e., what it is, what kind of jobs and wages the major leads to, and what kind of students would do great with it. Our study population is a set of over 200 high schools in Texas that send a high number of students to Texas A&M University. We randomly selected half of the schools to receive an invitation to participate in an informational workshop held by the Department of Economics at Texas A&M University in early September 2019. About 20 percent of the invited schools sent a guidance counselor to the informational workshop. Our outcome variables are measures of students’ interest in the field of economics when applying to and enrolling at Texas A&M University, with a particular focus on women and under-represented minority students.

### "Dynamic Sales Tax Competition: Evidence at the Border"
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper Series, 2020 with Nadia Greenhalgh-Stanley, Shawn Rohlin, Jeffrey Thompson

We examine both vertical and horizontal tax competition over time by studying the strategic response of county sales taxation to state sales taxes and to cross-border neighboring municipalities’ combined (state and county) taxes. Using county and state sales tax data from 2003 through 2009, we employ both static and dynamic panel analysis as well as an instrumental variables approach in combination with a border analysis. Our results confirm the presence of tax competition in the cross section, as previous studies have found. Results from the fixedeffects and dynamic panel analysis also indicate the presence of vertical competition, though quite small, as counties are consistently responsive to changes in their own state sales tax level across all models and specifications. However, the panel findings suggest little to no horizontal tax competition. Following Parchet (2019), we address additional concerns about endogeneity by instrumenting the neighboring-county sales tax rate with the state-level sales tax rate of the neighboring state. Results from instrumental variables analysis reinforce the presence of a small vertical tax competition between local and state sales tax policies. Interestingly, our results, like those of Parchet (2019), indicate that cross-border local sales tax rates act as strategic substitutes.

### "Going the Distance: The Impact of Accessible Transportation on Disability Employment"

Transportation is a well-established barrier to employment for individuals with disabilities, but access to public transportation is a guaranteed right under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Paratransit programs exist nationwide to help improve transportation access for both the elderly and people with disabilities, but do these programs improve employment and labor force outcomes for prime-age disabled people? I intend to measure the effect of a new acessible transportation program on disability employment, labor force participation, incomes, and public assistance reciept in the areas served by the policy. 

### "Evaluating the Effects of Parental Preferences for Special Education" 
with Olivia Edwards

Employing an oversubscribed lottery-IV identification strategy, we examine the effects of attending these specialized charter schools on various educational outcomes for students with special education (SPED) needs. Additionally, we investigate treatment effect heterogeneity by exploring the impact of different instructional styles within these schools. We explore the alignment between parental preferences and the effectiveness of instructional approaches in catering to the needs of SPED students. By examining the results from the oversubscribed lottery-IV identification, we are able to identify the causal effects of attending SPED-oriented charter schools on academic achievement, social-emotional development, and other key outcomes. Moreover, we delve into parental preferences for SPED educational settings through the application of a structural demand model. This analysis enables us to assess whether parental preferences align with the reduced-form evidence on instructional effectiveness for SPED students. By comparing parental preferences with the outcomes observed in the oversubscribed lottery-IV identification, we gain insights into potential misalignments and areas of improvement in meeting the needs of SPED students.
