title: "Sets in Rd determining k taxicab distances"
---
We address an analog of a problem introduced by Erdős and Fishburn, itself an inverse formulation of the famous Erdős distance problem, in which the usual Euclidean distance is replaced with the metric induced by the l 1-norm, commonly referred to as the taxicab metric. Specifically, we investigate the following question: given d, k ∈ N, what is the maximum size of a subset of R d that determines at most k distinct taxicab distances, and can all such optimal arrangements be classified? We completely resolve the question in dimension d= 2, as well as the k= 1 case in dimension d= 3, and we also provide a full resolution in the general case under an additional hypothesis.
