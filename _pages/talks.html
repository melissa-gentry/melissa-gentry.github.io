### The Impact of Price and Prestige on SLAC Admission Yields
Academy of Business Research; Biloxi, MS 2020 (impacted by COVID)

Olivia Edwards and Blakely Fender


We investigate the effect of changes in tuition-pricing strategies employed by small liberal arts colleges (SLACs) on admissions yields. The two most common pricing strategies involve the differences between sticker-price tuition and actual cost of attendance for a student. Some colleges have moved towards a tuition model where they have lowered the posted tuition to the average cost of attendance for students and rarely discount tuition by granting aid. Other colleges have maintained the more traditional tuition model where posted tuition is quite high, but it is regularly discounted to students on an individual basis through aid. Using a standard DiD framework, we find no impact on admissions yield. When stratifying the sample on the prestige of the college, as determined by popular college ranking companies, we find there is still no impact for prestigious SLACs but less prestigious SLACs see a weakly significant increase in yield.
